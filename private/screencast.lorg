* GO THROUGH OLD SLIDES
** This is Leisure, a web-based computing environment.
** Use Leisure to make and deploy multiuser web applications, like this game.
** Reveal hidden code and data using the Leisure bar
** Data changing and updating
*** See data change when you change your name and click pieces on the board
*** See the board change when you edit the data
*** See the board change when you edit the user data
*** See the board change when you edit the view definition
** Code evaulation
** Leisure provides its own language and also supports other languages, such as JavaScript and CoffeeScript.
* Leisure: The Document Is the Machine!
- environment
  - for both development and deployment
  - persistent
  - collaborative
  - live
  - literate
  - document-based
  - runs on the web
  - ployglot: JS, Leisure, ... (CoffeeScript, ClojureScript soon)
- Leisure language
  - purely functional
  - lazy
  - dynamically typed
  - homoiconic

* Collaborative connect 4 game
  - Leisure code that monadically changes data blocks
  - HTML templates in the doc
    - one for the board
    - one for a square (nested in board)

* notebook presentation
- for development and deployment
- Start with data slides hidden (toggle button in leisure bar)
- what slides are
- sidebar/floating notes
- slide/fancy/plain mode
- properties/tags inherited by functions in slides
- themes
- local slides

* collaboration at both development and runtime
- each document is a collaborative virtual machine
- human-readable data (yaml)
- data blocks (mud, etc)

* (maybe this should all be one point?) virtual text file architecture (data blocks)
- data blocks allow scalability
- blocks can contain metadata about their text (parsed objects, etc.)
- browser doesn't have to render the entire file, only what's visible
- efficient, in-place updating

* specially interpreted data blocks
- view definitions
- code
- data
- links to render data in views

* language features
- metaprogramming
- functional
- monadic i/o interface
- access arguments of partially applied functions
- source map support

* development features
- test cases
- repository comments
- ast display
- output can dynamically update
- renders HTML/SVG/view output directly
