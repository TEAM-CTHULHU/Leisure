# Leisure

Leisure is a lazy, untyped, functional language that supports metaprogramming.  It aims to be comfortable,
easy to customize, and fun to use.

Here is a more complete [readme and demo](http://zot.github.com/Leisure/doc.html).

## Convenient
Leisure provides a convenient syntax and powerful tools to help people try things out quickly, be productive, and customize the language to suit their needs.
Leisure's syntax is based on Lambda Calculus and borrows things from Haskell and other languages while still remaining very small.  It also includes metaprogramming
facilities to allow powerful customization.

## Notebook Style Interactive Development

For decades, programming has been done primarily in glorified text editors.  Some great strides have been made in various IDEs, but typically the
programmer is still burdened with a neverending "write, compile, debug, test, repeat" development cycle.  Why do you keep settling for this when
clearly we can do better?

While still heavily under development, Leisure is meant to push the envelope here and provide a fully interactive development environment where
your code is executed and errors show while you're writing it. Functional programming is quite foreign to new comers, but what if you could
instantly view the parse tree of the code you wrote? Or specify test arguments to your function and see the results live as you make
changes to your code in real time?  Our goal is to show programmers there has to be a better way, and we've settled for the status quo for far too long.
