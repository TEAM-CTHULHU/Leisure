# Welcome to Leisure (here's the [project page](https://github.com/zot/Leisure))!

Leisure reveals arcane secrets so that you can write modern programs using the enlightened ways of the ancients!

# Leisure is a **Toy**

Programming ought to be fun, easy, and interesting, and it should have there should be cool stuff to play with.  Leisure tries to make it that way.  This is a Leisure notebook that explains a little about the language and environment.
***
## Notebooks: Interactive Development and Zero-Install Deployment

What if markdown code blocks contained real, executable code?  That's the case with Leisure.  Leisure programs are markdown files.

For decades, programming has been done primarily in glorified text editors.  Some great strides have been made in various IDEs, but typically the
programmer is still burdened with a neverending "compile, test, debug" development cycle.  Why do we keep settling for this when clearly we can do better?

LISP programmers know the REPL -- the command line interactive programming interface, but REPLS usually have only a single line of input.  While still heavily under development, Leisure pushes this
envelope with a fully interactive, document-based development environment where you can present and execute your code, errors show when you make them, tests execute as you change your code, and documentation is rich and interactive.
Functional programming can be quite foreign to newcomers, but what if you could
instantly view the parse tree of the code you wrote? Or specify test arguments to your function and see the results live as you
change your code?  Our goal is to show programmers a better way; we've settled for the status quo for far too long.

Here's one example; below is a test case that compares val with 3 and it automatically runs whenever you change the code.  Try changing val to something
other than 3, and click outside the box.  Then, change it back to 3.  You can click the arrow to verify the value of val for yourself.

```
val = 3

#@test "val"
#@expected "3"

val
```

In Leisure, just like in Smalltalk, you deploy the development environment.  Be default, users can interact directly with Leisure.  You can disable that behavior, and you can
also have your code decide to pop up a Leisure code box later.

## Comfortable

Like LISP and Haskell, Leisure traces its roots to Lambda Calculus.  It tries to remain true to Lambda Calculus, while
also providing a comfortable syntax, with infix notation and indentation to help reduce the need for parentheses.

Here are some code definitions.  You can click the diagram button next to them to see how the computer decodes the program into a structure,
in order to compile it to JavaScript and you can click the arrow button to evaluate the expression.

```
z = 1
add3 a b c = a + b + c

add3 1 2 3
```

## Customizable

Leisure provides some powerful customization techniques, called "metaprogramming."  Leisure's compiler uses Leisure
structures and you can change how it works by defining macros and even registering "parsing filters" that rewrite the structures
before the macros get them.  The goal, here, is to give power to programmers to help them get things done.

concat[...] is an example -- concat['a: ' 1 ', b: ' 2] expands to (concat (cons 'a: ' (cons 1 (cons ', b: ' (cons 2 nil))))), so you can avoid those
extra parentheses (like in Clojure, commas are optional).  Click on the diagram buttons to see it in action.

```
conc1 = concat['a: ' 1 ', b: ' 2]
conc2 = concat['a: ', 1 ', b: ', 2]
```

## Lazy, functional, and Untyped

Like Haskell, Leisure is lazy.  Try clicking the arrow, below, next to ignore2nd.
It doesn't crash, because Leisure doesn't evaluate the second argument to ignore2nd.  Leisure uses "call by need," like Haskell, instead
of "call by value," like C, Java, and LISP.  Also, just like in Haskell, *data* is lazy, too!  In Leisure, you can make
infinite lists, like in Haskell.  Like Haskell, but unlike Clojure, Leisure lists are just a regular data structure.

```
ignore2nd a b = a

ignore2nd 1 (2 / 0)

ones = [1 | ones]

take 5 ones
```

Laziness also means you can factor your code more easily, because you can define terms you use in one place, even if they
depend on other terms that are invalid in some cases (locally defined terms act like functions).  Try these expressions, below...

```
f x y = do
  a = x
  b = x / y
  eq y 0
    a
    b

f 2 0
f 2 2
```

Leisure is functional; it doesn't allow side effects -- but not because side effects are somehow *evil*; it's because in a lazy language,
side effects lead to very strange behavior that's very hard to understand and fix.  The idea is to have side effects outside the Leisure environment and
access them using standard functional techniques, like monads and FRP.

Leisure is untyped: it does have data types, but its variables and functions are untyped, like LISP's.

## Webby

As you can see, Leisure runs in a web page, and it lets you do web pagey things.  Click the arrow buttons, below:

```
rect nil
polygon nil

svgConcat [(translate (circle nil) 10 10) (rect nil)]
```

# The Language

Leisure is a modified version of the Untyped Lambda Calculus, with data types, the let construct
(for recursion and definitions), simple pattern matching, macros, parse filters, and syntax tokens and groups.

But wait, how can there be data types if Leisure is untyped?  *Variables* and *functions* in Leisure are untyped, like in LISP, but unlike in Haskell.
Just like in LISP, *data,* however, does have types -- a regular Leisure list has the "cons" type, for instance.

```
getType [1]
```

## Indentation

Indentation in Leisure just adds grouped terms to the end of the term before the indentation:

```
[
  1
  2
  [
    3
    4]]
```

## Definitions

To define a term, just use '=', like this:

```
x = 3

addToX a = a + x

addToX 10
```

## Anonymous Functions

You can create anonymous functions, using \ for lambda, like in Haskell:

```
(\a b . a + b) 1 2
```

## Data types

To define a data type, just return a lambda.  Here's a second definition of the 'cons' function, to demonstrate:

```
cons2 a b = \f . f a b

getType (cons2 1 nil)
```

## Simple Pattern Matching

Leisure has only simple pattern matching: type assertions.

```
car name = \f . f name
bike name = \f . f name

identifyVehicle anything = 'Not a vehicle'
identifyVehicle thing::bike = concat['A Bike: ' (thing id)]
identifyVehicle thing::car = concat['A Car: ' (thing id)]

identifyVehicle (bike 'fred')
```

## Do

Like Haskell, Leisure supports a "do" construct.  Do can bind monads and create "let" terms.

```
do
  x <- prompt 'What is your name?'
  x = concat['Hello, ' x '.']
  print x
  x = concat['The previous message was: ' x]
  print x
  print concat[x ' -- ' x]
```
