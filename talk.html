## We like to share our toys.
## Leisure is **open source**; you are invited to play with it and changes it.
## Please feel free to use it to make cool stuff!

# Programming should be fun!

## Programming ought to be fun, easy, and interesting, and there should be cool stuff to play with.  Leisure tries to make it that way.
