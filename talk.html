## macros rewrite expressions, using cons/lcons (like cons, but with start and end positions)
## Combining groups with macros can work like varargs
### [
```
ex1 = [1 2 3]

### concat[
```
ex2 = concat[1 2 3]

#### making concat[ a separate macro makes it more convenient, because it eliminates parentheses

## Right now, Do (like in Haskell) is a parse filter
## At this point, once you turn on a parse filter, it affects subsequent imported files

## Key differences
* REALLY easy to use, simple, and flexible
   * This is very different from COM/OLE/CORBA/DCE/RCP/SOAP/RMI!
   * Pub/sub (data exchange), not RPC (remote invocation)
   * Protocol doesn't change with your app (no IDL)
   * Key/value pairs (like SNMP, REDIS, Zookeeper -- much simpler to use)
   * Commands are just JSON arrays: [["set", "a", 5],["set", "b/c", 6]]
   * Only 6 commands: value, set, put, splice, removeFirst, removeAll
   * Simple protocol makes it very, very easy to hook up any language
      * No... REALLY! It does!
      * All my current commands are in JavaScript and Bash
   * Many ways to connect: socket, WebSocket, direct (same process), WebWorker (future)
* Storage
   * Each key can have its own storage mode
   * Peers are up-to-date as soon as they connect
* Metamodel
   * Peer settings (subscriptions, peer name, etc)
   * Can be used for service discovery/registration
* "xus" command
   * Does a lot of setup for you
   * Sufficient for a lot of tasks just by itself
