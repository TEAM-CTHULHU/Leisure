#Primordial Programming...

Nontrivial uses of untyped Lambda Calculus
***
#Disclaimer: I'm not selling a language or a paradigm

Languages are tools and they all have advantages and disadvantages

Programmers should know more languages, because they open your mind to different ways to solve problems

To understand a language, you need to program something nontrivial in a way that depends on that language's "goodies"

Examples of some fairly uncommon languages that can teach you interesting things (this list is not exhaustive)...

<table>
<tr><td>LISP (macros, code is data)
</td><td>Scheme (continuations)
</td></tr><tr><td>Haskell (lazy evaluation, monads, etc.)
</td><td>Scala (OO + functional, actors)
</td></tr><tr><td>Erlang (actors)
</td><td>Go/Oberon (implicit interfaces)
</td></tr><tr><td>TCL (dual-ported objects, uplevel)
</td><td>Smalltalk/Squeak/Scratch (foundational OO)
</td></tr><tr><td>OPS5 (forward chaining)
</td><td>Prolog (unification/backtracking)
</td></tr><tr><td>Icon (goal-directed execution/backtracking)
</td><td>FORTH/PostScript/Factor (stack languages, compile-time execution)
</td></tr><tr><td>Lua (meta model)
</td><td>Self/Io (pure prototype-based OO)</td></tr>

If you think Java's and C++'s Generics are complicated, that's just peanuts compared to Haskell's

#Some neato things you can do in Lambda calculus

* easy generators
* easy custom control structures
* infinite streams (good for filtering/generate and test)
* varargs (without extra language constructs)
* deep code factoring (eg. combinators)
