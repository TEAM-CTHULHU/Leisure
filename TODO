TODO
* quotes for names
* allow args in definitions: func arg1 arg2 = body => func = \arg1 arg2 . body
* allow implicit recursion?  -- seems like this should just work, for the compiled version.  For substitution, it could prepend rec for you
* a-b recursion? -- it could do a pass to get function names, first


DONE
* print VM contexts


DEFERRED
* debug VM
