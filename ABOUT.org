* What Leisure is
Leisure is a new programming language, along with its online, collborative,
document-based, multilingual environment.

Each collaborative Leisure document is like its own virtual machine.  You can
interact with it and even change it as it runs.

Leisure harkens back to many earlier environments:
- Smalltalk: 1972
- The Lisp Machine: 1981 (or earlier)
- Hypercard: 1987
- Mathematica: 1991

Of these systems, Leisure is probably most similar to Hypercard and Mathematica, but it
differs in several important ways:
- Online
- Collaborative
- Multilingual
- Free
